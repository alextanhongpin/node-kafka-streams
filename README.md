# node-kakfa-streams

Exploring kafka streams with nodejs.

- Seems like there is no official kafka-streams library for nodejs.
- Third-party lib wasn't actively maintained either
- There are specific [examples](https://github.com/nodefluent/kafka-streams/tree/master/examples)
- The main library used is node-rdkafka, but there seems to be another official kafkajs lib
